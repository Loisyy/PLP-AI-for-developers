## üß© Part 1: Theoretical Analysis (40%)

### **Q1: Edge AI ‚Äî Reducing Latency & Enhancing Privacy**
**Explanation:**  
Edge AI enables processing of data directly on local devices (e.g., IoT nodes, smartphones, or embedded boards) instead of relying on remote cloud servers.  
This drastically reduces latency since inference happens locally and improves privacy by minimizing data transfer to third-party cloud services.

**Example:**  
Autonomous drones equipped with onboard AI chips (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano) use Edge AI to detect obstacles and make instant navigation decisions ‚Äî without internet dependency.

### **Q2: Quantum AI vs Classical AI in Optimization**
| **Aspect** | **Classical AI** | **Quantum AI** |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Computation Type** | Deterministic | Probabilistic (Quantum Superposition) |
| **Optimization Method** | Sequential search | Parallel exploration of multiple states |
| **Use Cases** | Simple, linear optimization problems | Complex, multi-variable optimization |

**Industries Benefiting:**  
- Pharmaceutical drug discovery  
- Financial portfolio optimization  
- Logistics and supply chain route planning  

**Summary:**  
Quantum AI integrates quantum computing principles to handle exponentially complex problems faster than traditional systems, potentially transforming sectors reliant on optimization.

### **Q3: Human-AI Collaboration in Healthcare**
AI systems increasingly complement human expertise rather than replace it.  
For example:
- **Radiologists:** AI assists in reading X-rays, CT scans, and detecting anomalies.  
- **Nurses:** Predictive models optimize patient monitoring and alert systems.

**Impact:**  
This collaboration enhances diagnostic accuracy, speeds up patient care, and reduces human error. However, it requires ethical oversight to prevent overreliance and ensure human accountability.

### **Case Study: AI-IoT in Smart Cities**
**Topic:** AI for Traffic Management  
**Analysis:**  
Integrating AI with IoT in smart cities enables real-time traffic optimization. Sensors collect vehicle flow and environmental data, while AI models predict congestion and adjust signals dynamically.

**Challenges:**  
1. **Data Security** ‚Äì Risks of unauthorized access or manipulation of IoT devices.  
2. **Infrastructure Cost** ‚Äì High deployment and maintenance expenses in developing cities.

**Outcome:**  
AI-IoT systems enhance urban mobility, reduce emissions, and contribute to sustainability goals.

## ü§ñ Part 2: Practical Implementation (50%)

### **Task 1: Edge AI Prototype**
**Goal:** Develop a lightweight image classification model to recognize recyclable vs non-recyclable items.

**Tools:** TensorFlow Lite, Google Colab (simulation)

**Process:**
1. Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
2. Convert model to TensorFlow Lite format.  
3. Test it on a sample dataset.

**Sample Code:**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Build a lightweight CNN model
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(16, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64,64,3)),
    MaxPooling2D(2,2),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
