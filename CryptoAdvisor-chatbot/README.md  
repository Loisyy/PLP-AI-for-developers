# CryptoBuddy - Rule-based Cryptocurrency Advisor Chatbot

**Theme:** "Your First AI-Powered Financial Sidekick!" ðŸŒŸ

## What it is
A beginner-friendly rule-based chatbot (Python) that analyzes a small, predefined cryptocurrency dataset and gives simple advice based on profitability (price trends, market cap) and sustainability (energy use, sustainability score).

## Files
- `cryptobuddy.py` â€” main chatbot script and demo run
- `README.md` â€” this file
- (Optional) Add screenshots and a 30s screen recording showcasing interaction for submission.

## How to run
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2. Run: `python3 cryptobuddy.py`
3. The script prints a demo conversation. For interactive use, you can import `CryptoBuddy` and call `reply()`.

## Notes & Stretch Goals
- This bot is rule-based (if-else). No external API calls are used (stretch: integrate CoinGecko).
- Add simple NLP (e.g., NLTK) for better intent parsing.
- Ethics: Always include a disclaimer â€” crypto is risky.

It demonstrates data-driven decisions without ML com
