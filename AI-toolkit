üìò Overview

This project demonstrates our understanding of AI tools and frameworks ‚Äî TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and spaCy ‚Äî through theory, implementation, and ethical reflection.

üß© Part 1: Theory

We explored:

The differences between TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and spaCy.

Real-world applications of these tools in industries such as healthcare, finance, and NLP.

How different frameworks complement each other in AI workflows.

üìÑ Full theoretical answers are included in the report (see /report/AI_Tools_Assignment.pdf).

ü§ñ Part 2: Practical Implementation
üß† Task 1: Classical ML (Scikit-learn)

Dataset: Iris Species

Goal: Predict species using a Decision Tree Classifier.

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall.

Notebook: /notebooks/iris_decision_tree.ipynb

üî¢ Task 2: Deep Learning (TensorFlow/PyTorch)

Dataset: MNIST handwritten digits.

Goal: Build a CNN to classify digits (>95% accuracy).

Notebook: /notebooks/mnist_cnn.ipynb

Includes training curves and sample predictions.

üí¨ Task 3: NLP (spaCy)

Dataset: Amazon Product Reviews.

Goal: Perform NER to extract product names/brands and analyze sentiment.

Notebook: /notebooks/spacy_ner_sentiment.ipynb

‚öñÔ∏è Part 3: Ethics & Optimization

We discussed:

Biases in datasets (e.g., unbalanced data or subjective reviews).

Use of TensorFlow Fairness Indicators and spaCy‚Äôs rule-based NLP to mitigate bias.

Debugging and optimization techniques for TensorFlow scripts.
